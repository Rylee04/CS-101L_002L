'''Problem: In this lab, the great prognosticator “Flarsheim”, 
will let the user choose a number in their head from 1 to 100. 
It will then ask the remainder of this number when divided by 3, 5 and 7. 
Your program must validate proper input on each. 
The remainder when divided by 3 can only be 0, 1 or 2. 
The remainders for 5 and 7 are different. 
To find what number the user is thinking of 
just find the number from 1 to 100 that has the same remainder 
for 3, 5, and 7 and astound them withthe result. 
They are then asked if they want to play again. 
The player may enter Y or N only.'''
