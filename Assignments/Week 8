'''Our program will allow the user to enter 2 types of grades: tests and programs.
Each of our scores is assumed to be out of 100, so we only need the user's score.
The tests are 60% of a studen'ts grade, while programs are 40%.
In order to calculate the final score, we multiply the mean score of the tests
by 0.6, and add it to the mean of programs multiplied by 0.4.
When we display scores, we will also show them the low, high, mean, and standard
deviation of their tests and programs
mean is the average. To calulate the mean, add all values and divide
by the number of values.
Standard deviation is calculated by taking each value and subtracting the mean,
then squaring the value. Afterwards, divide the sum of those values then take
the square root of that result.
Additionally: scores must be a float >= 0. Warn the user if they try to remove
a score that does not exist. If there are no scores, display "N/A"'''
