'''Problem: Ask the user for a grade 0 - 100.

Calculate weighted grade by multiplying the grade for a category
(labs, lab exams, and attendance) by the weight and the sum
of those results.

Output the weighted grade as well as the letter grade.

Warn the user if they enter a grade greater than 100 or less than 0,
then change it appropriately.'''
