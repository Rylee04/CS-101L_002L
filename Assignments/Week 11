'''Create a clock class that can keep track of hours, minutes, and seconds.
Use an __init__ method to set those attributes. Create a string override method
so that the hours, minutes, and seconds output with a 24 hour format style.
Create a tick() method for the clock. When it gets called, incremet the number
of seconds. If the number of seconds is 60 or more, increment the number of
minutes and set seconds to 0, and do so similarily with minutes and hours.
Add a new defualt argument to the init menthod which will be the clock type.
The parameter will default to 0, which will mean a 24 hour clock. The other
option, 1, will indicate a 12 hour clock. The internal clock will remain
unchanged, but when printed our output will change depending on what type
of clock is represented. Using the clock class, build a program to ask the
user for hours, minutes, and seconds, and then create a clock based on that.
Then write a loop that calls tick() once a second and then sleeps for a
second. Use the time module to sleep.'''
