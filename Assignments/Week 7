'''Write a program to read through a file containing information about fuel economy
and output the results to a file aboce a threshold that the user gives.
If the user wants to see all vehicles with a combined mpg greater than 50,
then your program will output that information to the file of their choosing.
The information is tab-delimited. When you read from a file, the values are separated
by the tab character \n. Your program will need to ask the user for a minimum fuel economy,
and be able to handle non-float data being entered. It should continually ask for a correct value.
It should also make sure they don't enter a value less than or equal to zero or greater than 100.
The program will ask for an input file and should loop until the user gives a valid file that can
be opened. It should also ask for an output file. While a FileNotFoundError 
won’t be thrown trying to open a file in write mode, it can generate an IOError.
When writing out to the output file, you should output the Year, Make and Model 
left justified by 40 spaces and the mpg right justified by 10 spaces. 
Your program should also be able to handle an incorrect combinedmpg column as in vehicles2.txt. 
When a bad value that can’t be converted is encountered, you should warn the user 
and give the year, make and model that had the error.'''
