'''Read in a datafile containing crime information for 2019.
Create functions to ask the user for a file, then use try exception so
if the read_in_file function throws an error you can loop and ask for
a file name again. It should then output the month that has the highest
crime rate and the offense that occurs the most. Afterwards, it should
ask for an offense then output a formatted report of the zip code and
how many times that offense occurs in that zip code using the dictionaries
from the functions given.'''
