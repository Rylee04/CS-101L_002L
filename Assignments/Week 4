'''In this program you are going to simulate a slot machine in Pierson Hall.

The slot machine has 3 reels and each reel will have numbers ranging from 1 to 10.

The user can choose how many chips they start out with.

They are allowed to wager between 1 to the amount of bank they currently have on each spin.

If they match 3 numbers, they will win 10 times their wager.

If they match 2 numbers they will win 3 times their wager.'''
