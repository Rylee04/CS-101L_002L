'''In this program you are going to simulate a slot machine in Pierson Hall.
The slot machine has 3 reels and each reel will have numbers ranging from 1 to 10.
The user can choose how many chips they start out with.
They are allowed to wager between 1 to the amount of bank they currently have on each spin.
If they match 3 numbers, they will win 10 times their wager.
If they match 2 numbers they will win 3 times their wager.'''
